# Summary:
Stored cross-site scripting (also known as second-order or persistent XSS) arises when an application receives data from an untrusted source and includes that data within its later HTTP responses in an unsafe way.

# Description:
Stored XSS, also known as Type-1 or Persistent XSS attacks, typically rely on unsanitized user input points for scripts permanently stored on the target servers.

# POC
